# Quick Fix: DNS TXT Record Not Found

## Immediate Action Steps

### Step 1: Verify DNS Record in Your Provider

**Go to your DNS provider (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.) and check:**

1. **Is the record there?**
   - Look for a TXT record with Host/Name = `_acme-challenge`
   - If it's missing, you need to add it

2. **Is the Host name correct?**
   - ✅ CORRECT: `_acme-challenge`
   - ❌ WRONG: `_acme-challenge.clickly.cv` (don't include the domain)

3. **Is the value correct?**
   - Must match EXACTLY what certbot showed you
   - No extra spaces, quotes, or characters

### Step 2: Add/Update the TXT Record

**If the record doesn't exist or is wrong, add it:**

#### Namecheap:
```
Type: TXT Record
Host: _acme-challenge
Value: [paste exact value from certbot]
TTL: Automatic
```

#### GoDaddy:
```
Type: TXT
Name: _acme-challenge
Value: [paste exact value from certbot]
TTL: 600
```

### Step 3: Wait and Verify

**Wait 5-10 minutes, then on EC2 run:**

```bash
# Transfer the verification script to EC2 first
# Then run:
chmod +x verify-dns.sh
./verify-dns.sh
```

**Or check manually:**
```bash
dig _acme-challenge.clickly.cv TXT +short
```

**You should see output like:**
```
"abc123xyz789...long-string..."
```

### Step 4: Retry Certbot

**Once DNS is verified, run certbot again:**

```bash
sudo ./generate-cert.sh
```

## Still Not Working?

### Check Certbot Logs

```bash
# On EC2
sudo cat /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log | tail -50
```

### Common Issues Checklist

- [ ] TXT record exists in DNS provider
- [ ] Host name is exactly `_acme-challenge` (not `_acme-challenge.clickly.cv`)
- [ ] Value matches exactly what certbot showed
- [ ] Record type is TXT (not A or CNAME)
- [ ] Waited 5-10 minutes after adding record
- [ ] Verified with `dig _acme-challenge.clickly.cv TXT +short`

### Alternative: Use HTTP-01 Challenge (Temporary Workaround)

If DNS-01 keeps failing, you can generate a standard certificate first (main domain only), then upgrade to wildcard later:

```bash
# This will only work for clickly.cv, not subdomains
sudo ./generate-cert.sh --standard
```

**Note:** This won't work for subdomains. You'll still need wildcard cert for `*.clickly.cv`.

1. Check the detailed guide: `FIX_DNS_TXT.md`
2. Run verification script: `./verify-dns.sh`
3. Check certbot logs: `./check-certbot-logs.sh`
4. Verify DNS propagation: `dig @8.8.8.8 _acme-challenge.clickly.cv TXT`
