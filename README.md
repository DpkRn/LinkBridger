## 🎯 About The Project

**LinkBridger** is a revolutionary, open-source social profile link management platform that empowers users to create personalized, memorable URLs for all their social media profiles. Unlike traditional link shorteners that generate random, forgettable codes, LinkBridger uses your username and platform name to create links that are both human-readable and professional.

### 🎨 The Vision

In today's digital-first world, professionals, creators, and developers manage multiple social media profiles across various platforms. LinkBridger was born from the need to simplify this complexity and provide a unified solution that combines **memorability**, **professionalism**, and **functionality** in one powerful platform.

### 🔍 The Problem It Solves

**The Digital Identity Crisis:**

1. **Long, Complex URLs**: Sharing links like `https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-doe-software-engineer-123456789/` is cumbersome and unprofessional
2. **Random Short Links**: Services like `bit.ly/xyz123` or `tinyurl.com/abc456` are forgettable and don't reflect your brand
3. **Fragmented Management**: Updating one link requires changing it across multiple platforms, emails, resumes, and business cards
4. **No Analytics**: Traditional link shorteners offer limited or premium-only analytics
5. **Expiration Issues**: Many services expire links or require paid subscriptions
6. **Lack of Personalization**: Generic short links don't build brand identity
7. **Platform Limitations**: Most services only support popular platforms, not custom ones

### ✨ The Solution

LinkBridger bridges this gap by providing:

- 🎯 **Personalized URLs** using your username and platform name (e.g., `clickly.cv/yourname/linkedin`)
- 🌐 **Single Hub Link** that acts as a landing page for all your profiles
- 📊 **Built-in Analytics** to track clicks and understand your audience
- 🔄 **Centralized Updates** that reflect instantly across all platforms

- 🎨 **Brand Identity** - links that reflect your personal or professional brand
- 🔒 **Privacy First** - no tracking scripts, no third-party analytics
- 🔐 **Link Privacy Controls** - three-tier visibility system:
  - **Public**: Visible everywhere (link hub, profile preview, search)
  - **Unlisted**: Visible in profile preview only, NOT in link hub (perfect for 100+ links without cluttering)
  - **Private**: Hidden everywhere, password-protected for direct access
- 👥 **User Discovery** - real-time search in navigation bar to discover other users' public profiles

## 🌟 Key Benefits

### 1. **Memorable & Professional Links** 🎯

**Before**: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-doe-software-engineer-123456789/`  
**After**: `https://clickly.cv/johndoe/linkedin`

Your audience will remember it! The pattern is simple: `domain/username/platform`. Once someone knows your username, they can easily guess your other platform links.

### 2. **Single Hub for All Profiles** 🌐

Share one link (`https://clickly.cv/yourname`) that acts as a beautiful landing page for all your social profiles. Visitors can browse and choose which platform to visit, creating a professional digital business card.

**Benefits:**
- One link to remember instead of dozens
- Professional landing page showcasing all your profiles
- Easy navigation for visitors
- Brand consistency across all platforms

### 3. **Centralized Link Management** 🔄

**The Real-World Scenario:**

Imagine you've shared your LinkedIn profile link in:
- Your resume (10 copies sent to different companies)
- Your email signature (hundreds of emails)
- Your business cards (50+ distributed)
- Your portfolio website
- Your GitHub profile
- Your Twitter bio
- Multiple job application platforms

**The Problem**: Your LinkedIn account gets banned or you change your username. Now you need to update links in all these places - but you don't even remember where you shared them!

**The LinkBridger Solution**: Update the destination URL once in your LinkBridger dashboard, and **all your shared links automatically redirect to the new URL**. No more hunting down old links!

### 4. **Click Analytics & Insights** 📊

Track which platforms get the most clicks to understand your audience:

- **See Engagement**: Know which platforms drive the most traffic
- **Optimize Strategy**: Focus on platforms that get the most engagement
- **Measure Impact**: Track the effectiveness of your networking efforts
- **Real-time Updates**: See clicks as they happen
- **Customizable Email Notifications**: Get notified based on your preferences
  - Link click notifications (customizable - toggle on/off)
  - Profile view notifications (customizable - toggle on/off)
  - Weekly report emails (customizable - toggle on/off)
  - Each notification type includes detailed information (platform, device, location, timestamp)

### 4.5. **Link Privacy & Protection** 🔒

Control who can access your links with three visibility levels:

- **Public Links**: Fully visible and accessible
  - ✅ Visible in your profile preview
  - ✅ Visible in link hub (`/username`)
  - ✅ Visible in user search results
  - ✅ Accessible via direct URL (`/username/platform`)
  - Anyone can see and access these links
  - Perfect for professional profiles and public content
  - No password required

- **Unlisted Links**: Hidden from hub but visible in profile preview
  - ❌ **NOT** visible in link hub (`/username`)
  - ✅ **Visible** in profile preview (`/profile/username`)
  - ❌ **NOT** visible in user search results
  - ✅ Accessible via direct URL (`/username/platform`) - **NO password required for direct access**
  - **Purpose**: Allows you to preserve many links (up to 100+) in your profile preview without cluttering the public link hub
  - Perfect for links that are less important but you still want visible in your profile
  - Ideal for maintaining a comprehensive profile while keeping the public hub clean and focused
  - Direct access works without password - anyone with the direct URL can access it

- **Private Links**: Completely hidden - require password to access
  - ❌ **NOT** visible in profile preview
  - ❌ **NOT** visible in link hub
  - ❌ **NOT** visible in user search results
  - ✅ Only accessible via direct URL (`/username/platform`) with correct password
  - Perfect for sensitive or personal content
  - Secure password prompt page with validation
  - Automatic redirect to destination after successful verification

**How It Works:**

**For Link Visibility:**
1. **Setting Link Visibility**: Use the lock icon on each link card to change visibility
2. **Public Links**: Immediately visible in link hub (`/username`), profile preview (`/profile/username`), and search results
3. **Unlisted Links**: 
   - ✅ Visible in profile preview (`/profile/username`)
   - ❌ NOT visible in link hub (`/username`) - keeps hub clean and focused
   - ✅ Accessible via direct URL (`/username/platform`) - NO password required

   - Ideal for less important links you still want visible in your profile

5. **Accessing Private Links**: When someone visits a private link directly, they see a password prompt page
6. **Password Verification**: The system securely verifies the password using bcrypt hashing
